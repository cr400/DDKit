       <h1>GETTING STARED WITH BRACKTES</h1>
       <h2>This is your guide!</h2>


       <p>
           Welcome to Brackets, a modern open-source code editor that understands web design. It's a lightweight,
           yet powerful, code editor that blends visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help
           when you want it
       </p>

       <p>
           <em>Bracktes is a differents type of editor.</em>
           Brackets has some unique features like Quick Edit, Live Preview and others that you may not find in other
           editors. And Brackets is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That means that most of you using Brackets
           have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor. In fact, we use Brackets every day to build
           Brackets. To learn more about how to use the key features, read on.
       </p>


       <h3>Projects in Bracktes</h3>
       <p>
           In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
           Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
           Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.
       </p>

    Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
    in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
    folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
    to open your own folder.
    You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
    sample project.

<h3>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h3>

<p>
    No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the
    <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS.
    Make a tweak to your CSS, hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> and you're back to editing HTML, or just leave the
    CSS rules open and they'll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> outside of
    a quick inline editor, they'll all collapse. Quick Edit will also find rules defined in LESS and
    SCSS files, including nested rules.
